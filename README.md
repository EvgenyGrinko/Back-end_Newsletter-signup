This project was made for practicing an access to the server via it's API. In this case the server is a mailchimp.com.
To make this project work you should include in the app.js file real values of an API Key (which can have only authorized users) and a List/Audience ID (this you can get after creation of a new List/Audience).
The style of this project is based on Bootstrap framework.
The list of modules for NodeJS you will easily find in the package.json file.
